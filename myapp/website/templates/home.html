    <h1>Time management in the technology industry</h1>
    <p>I am a second-year computer science student, and at the end of my first year of university, delivered online, I sat down to reflect on my experience. I figured that was the busiest year of my life thus far, and I have been swamped chasing assignment deadlines attending zoom classes; I could not believe how time went by so fast. Academically I was thriving, but I realized that my social life had been non-existent, and I did not get enough time to reconnect with myself. I was spending too much time on my studies since I wanted to do my best, which created an imbalance between my academic and personal life. Later on, I realized that some of my classmates were also facing the same issue.</p>
    <p>The technology industry is among the fastest-changing and the most innovative. When you’re new to it, there are many concepts you need to learn, and the learning process never ends when you graduate, there is always a new technology, and you need to be up to date to be valuable. If you are a student like me, you also need to work on projects beyond school to build your portfolio to get your first job or internship. Now, there is nothing wrong with all of this myself; I like to learn new things, but if you don’t manage your time well, you might end up in a boring daily routine of waking up and spending the rest of the day on the screen. But we don’t have to give up our social lives, hobbies, most especially all of our time to this. Therefore, we must learn how to manage our time effectively and balance work and personal lives. In this blog, I will be sharing tips I have found helpful and are helping me better manage my time and be more productive. A person outside the tech industry can also apply these tips.</p>
    <p>1. Organizing your tasks: It is helpful to have a list of tasks you plan to complete in a given period than just working on whatever you feel like doing at the moment. Lack of planning leads to forgetting some of the tasks and not prioritizing your tasks. What I like to do is have a daily list of tasks I want to do within a day, another one for the tasks I want to do within a week, and another one for tasks that I would like to do but which do not have deadlines, or there is not much pressure in completing them. These are most of the time like things I want to learn personally with no deadline pressure. These lists fulfill each other as  I pick tasks from the untimed list and add them to my weekly list, and I choose tasks from my weekly list and add them to my daily list. With my daily to-do, I just have to prioritize the tasks I have and set time slots for each. This helps me achieve my personal goals beyond academics from my long-term to-do list, and it also allows me to easily transition from task to task without wasting time since I already know what I am about to do next. </p>
    <p>2. Avoiding distractions during work/study: focusing on a single task helps you direct all your energy and attention to it, hence doing it to your best and faster. Before I tackle a task, I make sure that I have everything I will need throughout the entire time, which prevents me from getting up to grab those things midway. It is also essential to avoid potential distractions such as social media.</p>
    <p>3. Learn to say no: speaking from my experience, as a student, there is always a new course you can take to increase your skillset or a new project you can work on to build your portfolio on top of your academic responsibilities. Taking up everything that comes your way can make you feel overwhelmed and end up not delivering to the best of your ability on any of the tasks. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether you don’t have enough on your plate before saying yes to a new responsibility.</p>
    <p>4. Take time to rest: Last but absolutely not least, take time to recharge your energy battery, by having some time off work/study. This will prevent you from burnout and increase your productivity during work/study time. Also, remember that sitting in front of the computer for a long is not recommended for health reasons. Save your life by escaping from the screen for a while.</p>
    <p>There you have it; those are the four tips I have been using daily to improve my time management, which helps me get the work done in the allocated time and have time for my personal life. I hope you enjoyed reading and, most importantly, learned something you will try as well.</p>
